# OpenGL-Playground
Just fucking around in OpenGL

Included libraries: glad, glfw, glm, imgui (docking), spdlog. They are added as submodules, so run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Create project by running `.\generateproject-vs2022.bat`, it should get placed into `./projects/`.

Currently trying to implement a physics engine based on [this](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Physics-Engine-Development-Commercial-Grade/dp/0123819768) book
